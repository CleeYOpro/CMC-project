                    <p>The 15-bed Ida B. Scudder Hospice in Snehadeepam cares for terminally ill and marginalised
                        patients. Kamu* shuffled into the Palliative Medicine outpatient clinic one afternoon. The
                        weight of 88 years hunched his shoulders, and the tell-tale deformities in his hands and feet
                        spoke of a past battle with leprosy. A recent diagnosis – a probable malignancy gnawing at his
                        insides – was another cruel twist of fate in the twilight years of his life.</p>

                    <p>Pain, a relentless throb in his limbs, and the indignity of leaking bowels were his primary
                        concerns. The scars etched in his life by the contempt of his own kin who refused to touch him
                        were so profound he even refused a detailed clinical examination by the doctor. He clutched a
                        solitary hundred-rupee note – merely enough for the journey back and his dinner for the day. Our
                        team offered him free medication and diapers. Yet, he refused the diapers. "These hands," he
                        rasped, his voice rough with disuse, "cannot hold anything anymore."</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>Overwhelmed by his predicament, we decided to act. We found he lived in a desolate bus shelter
                        with flies buzzing around him. We got in touch with his only contactable relative and brought
                        Kamu to the hospital to manage his symptoms. It was then that a beacon of hope emerged – the
                        reopening of the hospice on the Snehadeepam campus.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>Kamu was the first patient admitted in 2024 to the recently dedicated Ida B Scudder Hospice. The
                        hospice is a haven. More than just food, shelter, and clean clothes, it is the caring touch,
                        gentle and unhurried, on his calloused figure. Kamu joined the staff in prayers, tears of
                        gratitude glistening in his eyes. "I found God here," he whispered, his voice thick with
                        emotion. He lived with dignity, his choices – be it food or conversation – respected. For about
                        two months, he was free from suffering, a weight finally lifted from his weary shoulders.</p>

                    <p>Kala* lives in Vellore District with her three energetic boys. Last year, her 29-year old
                        husband, a daily wage labourer, was diagnosed with terminal cancer. CMC's Department of
                        Palliative Medicine looked after him, subsidising his care and medications. Kala was
                        inconsolable when he passed away. She herself suffers from a seizure disorder. How would she
                        support her children, look after her own health needs and repay loans her husband had taken?</p>

                    <p>She moved forward bravely, selling their house and moving to her parents' home. "I do not want to
                        be an additional burden," Kala decided, "I will find work and support my children". Our
                        Palliative Care team spent time engaging with Kala to find a livelihood option to suit her
                        skills and help her become financially independent.</p>

                    <p>It was October 2020. Time was ticking fast for Suji*. Her husband was diagnosed with cancer in
                        his mouth. For almost a year he was taken care by the Palliative Care Team at CMC Vellore. She
                        knew by now her husband's days were numbered. Suji was only 37 years old. All her married life
                        she and her four-year-old daughter depended on him. In spite of the uncertainty ahead, her
                        priority at the time was to care for her dying husband. Before he passed away, he was full of
                        regret that he could not provide enough for their little girl.</p>

                    <p>The Palliative Care team knew Suji needed encouragement and resources to help her move on.
                        Knowing she had done a few courses on tailoring and embroidery a long time ago, they offered her
                        a sewing machine. Her passion was sparked to life as she began stitching clothes for her
                        daughter and herself with some old sarees. Word got around and women in her neighborhood wanted
                        her to stitch clothes for them too.</p>

                            class="story-img">
                    </figure>

                    <p>Suji says with gratitude, "People are surprised when they hear my story. They ask me, did CMC
                        really give you this sewing machine? Aren't they a hospital? I tell them yes, they are! They not
                        only helped when my husband was ill, they also helped me have hope in life."If you meet Suji,
                        her eyes do not only tell the story of her pain but hope for the future.</p>

                    <p>Today, along with stitching clothes she is trying to secure a commercial order. In the meantime
                        she has worked under other tailors to learn and upgrade her skills. In the future she would like
                        to have her own tailoring shop.</p>
